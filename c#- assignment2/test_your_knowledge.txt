1. When to use String vs. StringBuilder in C# ?
- When you don't need to modified a String and don't want to create a new object, you would use String. 
if you need to modify String frequently, you would use a StringBuilder. StringBuilder is mutable while String
is immutable.

2. What is the base class for all arrays in C#?
- The base class for all arrays in c# is System.Array.

3. How do you sort an array in C#?
- For example:
int[] numbers = {4,3,1}
Array.sort(numbers)

4. What property of an array object can be used to get the total number of elements in
an array?
- int[] numbers = {3,1}
int length = numbers.Length;


5. Can you store multiple data types in System.Array?
- if you want to do that, you can by creating an object array.
object[] mixedArr = new object[3];
mixedArr[0] = 1
mixedArr[1] = "great"
mixedArr[2] = 0.02

6. Whatâ€™s the difference between the System.Array.CopyTo() and System.Array.Clone()?
- System.Array.CopyTo copies an array to a new array that you specified. The new array must have the same 
data type and rank as the original array. you can also specify the starting index in the new array. 

- System.Array.Clone() is used to create a shallow copy of an existing array. If the original array contains reference types,
the new array contains reference to the same objects as the original array rather than the copies of those objects.
